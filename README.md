# REAR (EMNLP 2024)
REAR is a **RE**levance-**A**ware **R**etrieval-augmented framework for open-domain question answering. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17497)

The checkpoint is availible on huggingfaceü§ó. [[checkpoint]](https://huggingface.co/RUCAIBox/rear-llama-7b-hf)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Install dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the following codes:
    ```python
    from rear.src.inf import get_vllm_model
    from rear.src.routing import reliability
    get_vllm_model("RUCAIBox/rear-llama-7b-hf")
    example = {
        "question": "Who won the first Noble Prize in Physics",
        "ctxs": [
            "Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen won first Nobel Prize in Physics.",
            "Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen won it for discovery of X-rays",
            "Albert Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics",
            "The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award.",
            "First law of thermodynamics was stated by William"
            ]
        }
    final_answer = reliability(example)['rely_answer']
    print(final_answer)
    ```

## üîç Training and Inference Scripts

1. Training.
    ```bash
    bash train.sh meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf [model output path] [training data] [deepspeed config file]
    ```

2. Inference.

    First, to generate answers and the path-reliability scores:

    ```bash
    python rear/inference.py \
        --model_path RUCAIBox/rear-llama-7b-hf \
        --phase reliability \
        --source [test file] \
        --outfile [output file(1)]
    ```
    Second, to generate the knowledge-consistency scores:
    ```bash
    python rear/inference.py \
        --model_path RUCAIBox/rear-llama-7b-hf \
        --phase consistency \
        --source [output file(1)] \
        --outfile [output file(2)]
    ```

    The QA pairs, along with the documents used for inference, are available for download at the following link: [[data]](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yhao-wang/rear-eval). 

    After running these scripts, if you have provided **"reference"** as the ground truth in the test source data, the **EM** (Exact Match) and **F1** scores will be automatically calculated.
